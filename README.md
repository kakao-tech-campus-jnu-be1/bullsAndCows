# Bulls And Cows Game

This is a simple command-line version of the Bulls and Cows game, where the computer generates a 4-digit number and the player has to guess the number in a maximum of 10 tries.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a zip file and extract it.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

3. Run the command `python main.py` to start the game.

4. The computer will generate a random 4-digit number.

5. Enter your guess for the number.

6. If the input value is not a 4-digit number, the program will prompt you to enter a valid input.

7. The program will then calculate the number of bulls and cows for your guess and display it.

8. You have 10 tries to guess the number correctly.

9. If you successfully guess the number within 10 tries, the program will print "Congratulations! You won!".

10. If you are unable to guess the number within 10 tries, the program will print "Sorry, you lost. The number was XXXX", where XXXX is the random number generated by the computer.

## Function Procedure

1. The `generate_random_number()` function generates a random 4-digit number using the `random` module.

2. The `get_user_input()` function receives input from the user, checks if the input is a valid 4-digit number, and returns the input as an integer.

3. The `calculate_bulls_cows(secret_number, guess)` function takes two arguments: the secret number generated by the computer and the guess made by the player. It calculates the number of bulls and cows for the guess and returns a tuple containing the number of bulls and cows.

4. The `play_game()` function puts everything together and runs the game. It generates a random number using the `generate_random_number()` function, receives input from the user using the `get_user_input()` function, calculates the number of bulls and cows using the `calculate_bulls_cows()` function, and prints the result. It repeats this process for a maximum of 10 tries or until the player guesses the number correctly. If the player guesses the number correctly within 10 tries, it prints "Congratulations! You won!". If the player is unable to guess the number within 10 tries, it prints "Sorry, you lost. The number was XXXX", where XXXX is the random number generated by the computer.
